# 🏦 Banking Management System – OOP + Streamlit  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a **Banking Management System** built in **Python (OOP principles)** and deployed as a **Streamlit web app**.  
It simulates a simple banking system where users can:  
- Create an account  
- Deposit / Withdraw money  
- View account details  
- Update email or PIN  
- Delete account  

All data is stored in a **JSON file**, ensuring persistence across sessions.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Account creation with auto-generated account number  
✅ Deposit & Withdraw money with validations  
✅ Update account details (email, PIN)  
✅ Delete account permanently  
✅ JSON-based storage (persistent data)  
✅ Interactive **Streamlit web interface**
